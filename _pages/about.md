Hi! I'm Zhiyong, a second-year Ph.D. student at Texas A&M University in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. My major research interest is applied cryptography, and recently I'm working on zero knowledge proofs and its applications. My research supervisor is Prof. [Yupeng Zhang](http://people.tamu.edu/~zhangyp/).

I received my B.S. degree from [ACM Honors Class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home), [Zhiyuan College](https://zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/html/zhiyuan/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2019. There I worked with Prof. [Weinan Zhang](http://wnzhang.net/).
